Hospital readmissions for diabetes patients are a major problem, leading to worse outcomes, higher costs, and wasted resources.  
AIDRP leverages AI to accurately predict and prevent 30-day readmissions for diabetes patients.

st.header('How it Works',divider='rainbow')

st.write("""
Our model is trained on real-world electronic health record (EHR)  data from the U.S. Health Facts Medical Database, which contains medical records  for 100,244 diabetes patients  from 1999 to 2008.  

This allows our AI to:

- Identify patients at high risk of readmission ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Target interventions and resources to avoid readmissions ‚ôªÔ∏è

This AI-enabled solution has the potential to:

- Significantly enhance outcomes and decrease costs for both diabetes patients and healthcare institutions 
- Reduce medical waste production 
- Provide quality health to all

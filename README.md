<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Problem Description
First of all let's understand The term "**readmission**‚Äùrefers to the readmission of a patient to the same department within a certain period due to the same disease after discharge. The vast majority of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), require repeated hospitalizations due to poor disease control. Many factors have been highlighted as contributors to patient readmission. Common causes include inappropriate or incomplete treatment, relapse, premature discharge.CMS has created many programs to improve the quality of care of patients. One of these programs is called the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program

The 30-day hospital readmission rate following an index hospitalization has become a crucial performance metric utilized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In 2014, CMS issued record-breaking fines to 2,610 hospitals for excessive rates of patients being readmitted within a short period of time post-discharge. Preventable readmissions lead to increased financial burdens and psychological stress for patients, repeated overutilization of medical resources, and heightened bio waste production. In 2017, the estimated United States healthcare costs related to diagnosed diabetes was approximately $327 billion, of which $237 billion represented direct medical expenditures. Recent projections estimate a 54% increase in diabetes prevalence between 2015 and 2030, which translates to over $622 billion in associated costs. Compared to overall 30-day readmission rates for inpatients, those diagnosed with diabetes have a substantially higher readmission rate ranging from 14.4% to 22.7%. According to 2012 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Nationwide Inpatient Sample data, a modest 5% reduction in readmissions would result in significantly fewer annual admissions and an estimated $1.2 billion in cost savings. Undoubtedly, readmissions play a major role in escalating hospital-related costs, especially among elderly diabetes patients. Consequently, diabetes-related readmissions impose a growing economic burden on patients and healthcare finance, while also propagating medical waste and suboptimal resource utilization.




## Solution 
AIDRP is an AI-driven platform that can accurately predict and reduce 30-day hospital readmission rates for diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. The platform is boosted by Gemini API, an AI assistant that answers users' questions regarding diabetes care. By enhancing prediction and prevention of avoidable readmissions, AIDRP can assist hospitals in improving quality of care, reducing costs, and optimizing performance measures. This solution also provides value to DM patients directly. The predictive model is trained on real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from the U.S. Health Facts Medical Database, which contains medical records for 100,244 diabetes patients from 1999 to 2008. It leverages relevant patient health information to identify key drivers of readmissions. Successful implementation of this AI-enabled solution has the potential to significantly enhance outcomes and decrease costs for both diabetes patients and healthcare institutions, reduced medical waste production and provides quality health.


## Users
- Hospital administrators could use the model to identify patients at high risk of readmission and target interventions to reduce those rates. This would help improve hospital performance on readmission metrics.

- Healthcare providers like doctors, nurses, and care coordinators could use the model's predictions to focus additional resources on high risk patients during and after hospitalization. This would aim to improve the quality of care and prevent readmissions.

- Population health management teams at healthcare organizations could use the model to stratify diabetes patient populations by readmission risk. This would allow tailored outreach and care programs to address the needs of different risk groups.

- Healthcare payers like insurance companies could potentially utilize the model to inform care management and transition of care support for their diabetic members. This could reduce their costs related to preventable readmissions.
